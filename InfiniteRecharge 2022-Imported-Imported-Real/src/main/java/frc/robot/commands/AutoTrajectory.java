/*This command litterally does nothing. I most likely added it to do something related to autoTrajectories and then had
 * an ADHD moment and forgot about it. Or it didn't work. At this point I don't know, it was like 3 or 4 months ago.
 * Should've documented back then i guess
 * Live, Laugh, Learn
 * well build season is hectic not my fault 
 * at least im documenting it now
 * Hi future person reading this
 * that future person is probably me
 * bc there is absolutley no reason anyone else should be reading this portion of the code
 * and if someone is, screenshot it and DM/Contact me in any way and i'll give u a dollar or something
 * idc lol
